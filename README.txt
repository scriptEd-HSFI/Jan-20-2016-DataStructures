JAN-19-2015 Intro to Data Structures
================================================================

This repo contains an excercise.js file that we will be using in the "We
Do" portion of the class. The project.js file is the skeleton code for
the longer project that we will be doing to practice using arrays. We
will be building our own powerball number generator and checker :).
